This file is a SQLite database that stores data about NBA players' statistics. It is used by the Flask app to fetch player
information and statistical data from the database to make predictions. The sqlite3.connect("nba_stats.db") function is used
to establish a connection to the SQLite database. This is required to execute SQL queries that interact with the database.
The connection is then used to execute SQL queries that fetch/manipulate data.
After the query execution, the connection is closed with conn.close().

sqlite3 nba_stats.db < setup_db.sql to update database from setup_db.sql
